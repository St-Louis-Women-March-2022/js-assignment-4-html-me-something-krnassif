            <p>In 2017, I took my first international trip, which was to Italy. I was really excited to be travelling out of the country, but was also a little nervous. After the 14 hour plane ride, I arrived in Rome. While I was in Italy, I saw the following cities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#rome">Rome</a></li>
                <li><a href="#florence">Florence</a></li>
                <li><a href="#pisa">Pisa</a></li>
            </ul>

               <h2>Rome</h2>

               <p>Rome was the city that I stayed in during my trip to Italy. It was unbelievable to see some of the most famous landmarks in the world. I took a tour of the Roman Colosseum. It was massive and I climbed lots of stairs, but the view of the amphitheatre was well worth it. That evening, I went and visited the Trevi Fountain. It was surrounded by people, but I was still able to get some good photos. The following day I went and saw the Pantheon. That was probably one of my favorite attractions of the trip. The light beaming through the oculus in the ceiling was gorgeous. Another breathtaking experience was touring the Vatican and Sistine Chapel. The art was amazing and I learned a lot about Italian history from our tour guide.</p>

               <h2>Florence</h2>

                  <img class="bordered" src="images/David.jpg" alt="The Statue of David" />

               <p>A couple days into my vacation, I took a two-day trip to Florence, Italy. I made sure to visit the Accademia Gallery, where the famous Statue of David is housed. The amount of detail and the sheer size of this sculpture is <em>unbelievable</em>. While I was in Florence, I also made sure to see the Piazza Duomo. Although I did not go inside the Duomo itself, I still admired the exterior of the building. Later, I strolled over the Ponte Vecchio bridge, where artists sell handmade jewelry, art, and other goods. I ended my day by visiting the Boboli Gardens. It was very peaceful and filled with hundreds of beautiful plants and flowers. It was a relaxing way to end my stay in Florence.</p>

               <p>Pisa was the final city I visited in Italy. I took a one-day trip by train. The main attraction I wanted to see was, of course, the leaning tower of Pisa. The building itself is so tall and there is a grassy surrounding area to take photos. I had a great, filling lunch at a local cafe that cost around &euro;8, less than 10 US dollars! Afterward, I shopped at some locally-owned shops before heading back to Rome. It was a shorter day, but was worth the trip to see the tower.</p>
